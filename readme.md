### Description
Welcome to my Bachelor project at HEPIA, where I've used artificial intelligence to try to assist visually impaired individuals. Our prototype, developed in Python, employs object detection models like YOLO and SSDLite MobileNet V3 to identify objects in real time. It uses a synthetic voice to provide descriptions of these objects and can even calculate distances, enhancing user safety and independence. For more details, please refer to the project paper (only available in French). Stay tuned for the source code, which will be uploaded soon.

- The source code may follow in a few days.
